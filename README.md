# SLIME: a semantic soil-life metaweb

SLIME (Soil LIfe MEtaweb) is a knowledge graph on the trophic ecology of soil organisms that integrates several open databases covering major taxonomic groups across multiple trophic levels. SLIME allows users to find relevant information across integrated datasets and facilitates the reconstruction of local food webs based on local co-occurrence or co-abundance data.
