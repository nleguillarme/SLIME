# SLIME: a semantic soil-life metaweb

SLIME (Soil LIfe MEtaweb) is a knowledge graph on the trophic ecology of soil organisms that integrates several open databases covering major taxonomic groups across multiple trophic levels. SLIME allows users to find relevant information across integrated datasets and facilitates the reconstruction of local food webs based on local co-occurrence or co-abundance data.

## What does this repository contain?

- *graph.cfg*: an INI-like configuration file. In this file, you can specify the URI of the knowledge graph, change the path to the directory containing the data source configuration files, configure your triplestore connection and declare the ontologies that will be used to annotate the integrated data.
